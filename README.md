SQL Concepts Used:
* JOIN operations
* Aggregate functions (SUM(), COUNT(), AVG())
* Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), PARTITION BY)
* Sorting and filtering
## Project Structure
 – Basic SQL queries for initial insights.
 – Intermediate-level queries covering more complex joins and conditions.
 – Advanced SQL queries using CTEs, window functions, and ranking.
