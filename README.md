# SQL Music Store Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing a music store database using SQL. It covers various queries, ranging from beginner to advanced levels, to extract insights related to customers, purchases, invoices, music genres, and top artists.  

## Dataset Description  
The database consists of multiple tables, including:  
* **Employee** â€“ Stores employee details.  
* **Customer** â€“ Stores customer details.  
* **Invoice** â€“ Contains invoice records for music purchases.  
* **Invoice_Line** â€“ Provides details of each invoice transaction.  
* **Track** â€“ Stores track details like duration and genre.  
* **Album** â€“ Contains album information.  
* **Artist** â€“ Stores artist details.  
* **Genre** â€“ Categorizes music into different genres.

## Technologies Used  
* **Database:** PostgreSQL  
* **SQL Concepts Used:**  
  1. JOIN operations  
  2. Aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`)  
  3. Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
  4. Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `PARTITION BY`)  
  5. Sorting and filtering  

## Project Structure  
* **Basic SQL queries** for initial insights.  
* **Intermediate-level queries** covering more complex joins and conditions.  
* **Advanced SQL queries** using CTEs, window functions, and ranking.  

## Key Queries & Insights  

### ðŸ”¹ Easy Level Queries  
* Identify the senior-most employee with the highest job titles.  
* Determine the country with the most invoices.  
* Find the top 3 invoice amounts.  
* Identify the city generating the most revenue.  
* Find the best customer based on total spending.  

### ðŸ”¹ Moderate Level Queries  
* List emails of all customers who listen to rock music.  
* Identify the top 10 artists producing the most rock music.  
* Retrieve all songs longer than the average song length.  

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Level Queries  
* Calculate total spending by customers on a specific artist.  
* Identify the most popular music genre in each country.  
* Determine the highest-spending customer in each country.  

## How to Run the Queries  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MohanSaiPandeti/mohansaipandeti.github.io
2. Load the database into PostgreSQL.
3. Run the .sql scripts in your database client.
